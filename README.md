## ABSTRACT
Twitter as a microblogging platform has huge potential to become a collective source of intelligence that can be used to obtain opinions, ideas, facts, sentiments, and news. In this paper, we studied the role of Twitter as a news portal bearing in mind its global users network, its extraordinary short response time, and its short concise 140 character message. We applied 2 methods to detect news topic: undirected graph using lucene indexer and prefix tree using estMax method [1]. We provided a description of every method and its qualitative results
